Boots Quest DX is a really fun, really charming short game about finding _the best boots_. I find the atmosphere to be very reminiscent of some Flash games.

What is not to love about Boots Quest DX? Itś fun, witty, charming, chill, dream-like. It is a piece of art which relies on heart to convey a very heartwarming experience.

At first glance, it seems very unassuming: hand-drawn, crayon-style 2-frame idle animations; and the wonder of what will come next.

Then comes the first NPCs. And with them, the tone of the game is given. The graphics are this way not because it is cheap (asset packs would have done the trick in this case), but because they are a key component of the aesthetics.
The game is goofy, carefree, and you know it as soon as you set foot in the Outside Inn.

The objective is very simple: explore the land and find _the best boots_. That's it. No fancy combat, no platforming, nothing complicated. Just exploration. You, going places, finding boots, hats, tangerines, other random items, finding friends, finding people who don't seem friendly but actually are.

It is very simple at its core, and it is part of its charm.

It subverts references to classical adventure tropes, it brings a bit of nostalgia and a very oniric mood.

This game is an adventure. A short one. It's probably not going to last as a lifelong memory, but it will be an enjoable experience. A dream in video game format. Give it a try and see for yourself!
